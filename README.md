# wpa_supplicant.conf
This is the wpa_supplicant.conf template file I use to load on boot partition.

You just need to place your Wi-Fi's SSID on the line that reads ssid="YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
Then you enter your Wi-Fi password where it says psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

Place the file in the boot partition.

Done. :D
